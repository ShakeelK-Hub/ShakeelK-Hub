## 🚀 About Me


**I bring fresh perspectives to aged problems.**


I'm a soon-to-be graduate in software development with a solid academic foundation and a genuine drive to turn ideas into practical, impactful digital solutions.

While I may not yet have extensive industry experience, I bring something equally valuable: a fresh perspective, a structured and thoughtful approach to problem-solving, and a strong willingness to learn. I'm highly coachable, adaptable, and committed to continuous improvement.

I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and designing user-friendly, intuitive applications. From experimenting with front-end interfaces to building reliable back-end systems, I’m eager to contribute to real-world projects and grow alongside experienced teams.

I'm excited to bring energy, discipline, and a strong work ethic to an opportunity where I can learn, contribute, and make a difference.
